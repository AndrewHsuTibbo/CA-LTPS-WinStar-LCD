This is README file for LCD project

1. Hardware configuration
    
    To run this project you will need:
    
    - LTPS3
    - Tibbit #00-3 (Two direct I/O lines, +5VDC and GND)
    - Tibbit #41 (8-bit port extender + 200mm cable)
    - Any WinStar-compatible LCD display
    
    Cable soldering scheme:
    
    cable pin           WinStar LCD pin
    1 GND               1
    2 +5VDC             2
    3 LSB bit 0         4
    4 bit 1             5
    5 bit 2             6
    6 bit 3             11
    7 bit 4             12
    8 bit 5             13
    9 bit 6             14
   10 MSB bit 7         unused
   
   Also you should connect LCD pins: 1 and 16, 2 and 15 and install variable
   resistor between pin 3 and 1 (LCD contrast regulation)
